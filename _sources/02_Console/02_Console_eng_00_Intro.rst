Basics of programming in Python
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In the previous chapter, you had the opportunity to see and try writing a program to manage Karel, an animated robot. These programs allowed you to get a sense of what programming is and what writing programs in Python is like.

Now, we will more systematically go through the basics of the Python programming language and programming in it. This new pass will include what we have seen before, but also some basic concepts that were not exposed in the chapter on Karel.
